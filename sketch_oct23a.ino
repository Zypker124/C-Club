*   b. 1-a and 1-f are not connected
* 2. The arrays of pins of "a, b, c, d, e" by "1, 2, 3..."
*   a. Rows are separate from each other
*   b. 1-a, 1-b, 1-c... are connected
*   c. 1-a, 2-a, 2-a... are separated
* 3. + and - sections are used to power each half of the breadboard
*   a. They are called "power rails" and are powered with an external battery
